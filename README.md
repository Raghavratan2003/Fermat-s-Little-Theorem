# Fermat's Little Theorem Verifier 🧠🔢

This is a simple Python mini-project that verifies **Fermat's Little Theorem** for given integers `a` and `p`.

Fermat's Little Theorem states:
> If `p` is a prime number and `a` is an integer such that `gcd(a, p) = 1`, then  
> **a<sup>p−1</sup> ≡ 1 (mod p)**

---

## 📌 Features

- Checks if `p` is a prime number
- Verifies if `a` and `p` are coprime
- Uses efficient modular exponentiation (`pow(a, p-1, p)`)
- Gives clear explanation whether the theorem holds or fails

---

## 📥 Sample Input/Output

Enter value of a: 3
Enter value of p: 7
Fermat's Little Theorem holds for a = 3, p = 7

---

Enter value of a: 4
Enter value of p: 8
8 is not a prime number. The theorem may not hold.
Fermat's Little Theorem fails for a = 4, p = 8
